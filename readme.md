## Purpose

This repo can kickstart any project that needs a web, mobile, tablet or desktop application. The goal is to compose a fully working application from scratch using a common framework.

## Philosophy

All of it will be written in Javascript. A common set of command line tools will help with building, deploying, testing, linting, yada etc. It will be typed. It will be theme-able. I should be able to write a new component and copy it in no problem. It's docker backed so I can deploy on a docker compose or kubernetes platform. There is a process to boot up either a linux, mac or windows machine using a virtual box to test working in the platform. I can upgrade my apps from the base repo. At the end of six months, I have a fully fledged platform...
I'm thinking Apache Thrift for data/data modeling systems.
